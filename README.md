The goal of this project is to provide containers for the small scale industries who cannot afford containers which will be of high cost. we will be trying to provide containers in lower cost for the industries in need. This project will help small scale industries to increase their profit in business.

The work may be having following steps
1) creation of containers

2)deployment and verification of containers

3)monitoring of containers

initially the containers will be created in linux machine. we will be using LXC and LXD to do this.
then once the containers are deployed in cloud to the customers kubernetes will be used to monitor this.
